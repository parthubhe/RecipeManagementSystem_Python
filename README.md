This is a Recipe List Web Application built using Flask, a lightweight web framework in Python. The application allows users to create, view, edit, and delete recipes dynamically. Users can also browse through a list of recipes, view details of each recipe, and manage their recipe collection via a simple and intuitive web interface.

The project demonstrates the use of Flask for back-end development, HTML/CSS for front-end styling, and a basic in-memory storage for the recipes.
